We will participate [REEFSCAPE<sup>SM</sup> presented by Haas](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season) in:
- [Orange County Regional](https://cafirst.org/frc/orangecounty/)
- [Aerospace Valley Regional](https://cafirst.org/frc/aerospacevalley/)


## What We Do
The team builds a competitive robot with industrial-grade equipment in the
span of only 6 weeks. We go through a comprehensive effort to oversee
the robot-building process from start to finish. We work diligently in and
out of the classroom, spending countless hours to perfect our craft.
We are divided into specialized sub-teams during build season to be more
efficient and collaborative. Outside of build season, students experience
and learn every technical activity to further their knowledge.
