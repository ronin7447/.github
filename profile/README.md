# Rōnin Robotics FRC Team 7447 

Rōnin Robotics Team 7447 consists of 65+ members from Portola High School in Irvine, CA, who participate in FIRST® Robotics Competitions along with thousands of teams and students worldwide. 
We are student-led and organized into mechanical, electrical, programming, CAD, and business subteams.
From kickoff to competition, members plan, prototype, machine, wire, code, test, and document complete industrial-level robots within six weeks, then share our work through demos, workshops, and community events.

## Our Mission
Formed in 2019, Rōnin Robotics is dedicated to providing real-world engineering and FIRST® Robotics experiences within our local community. As a high school team, students don't need to have any previous experience to join. We offer students the opportunity to explore STEM and robotics through hands-on learning and teamwork. Our goal is to inspire and empower the next generation of innovators with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions and become future leaders in technology.
