## What We Do
The team builds a competitive robot with industrial grade equipment in the
span of only 6 weeks. We go through a comprehensive effort to oversee
the robot building process from start to finish. We work diligently in and
out of the classroom, spending countless hours to perfect our craft.
We are divided into specialized sub-teams during build season to be more
efficient and collaborative. Outside of build season, students experience
and learn every technical activity to further their knowledge.
